Some of the builds here were made with the original formulation
of the dometyl generator (preserved in the #legacy branch). For now, the old stl
files have been moved into **legacy** sub-directories, with updated stls
replacing them at the top-level of their respective directories.

The cases/parts generated by the current iteration are not *really*
fundamentally different however, so the readme guides within should still be
helpful regardless.
