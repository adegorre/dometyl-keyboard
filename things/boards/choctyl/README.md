## Switches / Caps
Designed for Choc V1, and tuned with MBK keycaps in mind (though choc cap
dimensions are likely consistent enough that you don't have to worry about
collisions with others).

## Fasteners
This example has been configured to use 6x2 magnets for attaching the plate and
tenting base.

## MCU mounting
Eyelets and case cutouts are included to fit the BastardKB Elite-C holder.
